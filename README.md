# üè† House Price Predictor ‚Äì An MLOps Learning Project

Welcome to the **House Price Predictor** project! This is a real-world, end-to-end MLOps use case designed to help you master the art of building and operationalizing machine learning pipelines.

You'll start from raw data and move through data preprocessing, feature engineering, experimentation, model tracking with MLflow, and optionally using Jupyter for exploration ‚Äì all while applying industry-grade tooling.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setting up Learning/Development Environment

To begin, ensure the following tools are installed on your system:

- [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or your preferred editor
- [Pip ‚Äì Python package installer](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) **or** [Podman Desktop](https://podman-desktop.io/)

---

## üöÄ Preparing Your Environment

1. **Fork this repo** on GitHub.

2. **Clone your forked copy:**

   ```bash
   # Replace xxxxxx with your GitHub username or org
   git clone https://github.com/xxxxxx/house-price-predictor.git
   cd house-price-predictor
   ```

3. **Setup Python Virtual Environment using venv:**

   ```bash
   python3.10 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

4. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   python3.10 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## üìä Setup MLflow for Experiment Tracking

To track experiments and model runs:

```bash
docker compose -f deployment/mlflow/docker-compose.yaml up -d
```

> üêß **Using Podman?** Use this instead:

```bash
podman compose -f deployment/mlflow/docker-compose.yaml up -d
podman compose ps
```

Access the MLflow UI at [http://localhost:5555](http://localhost:5555)

---

## üìí Using JupyterLab (Optional)

If you prefer an interactive experience, launch JupyterLab with:

```bash
python3.10 -m jupyterlab
```

---

## üîÅ Model Workflow

### üßπ Step 1: Data Processing

Clean and preprocess the raw housing dataset:

```bash
python3.10 src/data/run_processing.py \
--input data/raw/house_data.csv \
--output data/processed/cleaned_house_data.csv
```

---

### üß† Step 2: Feature Engineering

Apply transformations and generate features:

```bash
python3.10 src/features/engineer.py \
--input data/processed/cleaned_house_data.csv \
--output data/processed/featured_house_data.csv \
--preprocessor models/trained/preprocessor.pkl
```

---

### üìà Step 3: Modeling & Experimentation

You have two approaches for model experimentation:

#### Option A: Interactive Notebook Approach (Recommended for Exploration)
Use the Jupyter notebook for hyperparameter tuning and model selection:

```bash
# Launch JupyterLab and run notebooks/03_experimentation.ipynb
python3.10 -m jupyterlab
```

The notebook will:
- Perform hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
- Compare multiple algorithms (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost)
- Generate and save the optimal model configuration to `configs/model_config.yaml`
- Log all experiments to MLflow for tracking

#### Option B: Production Training Script
Once you have your optimal configuration from the notebook, train the final model using the script:

```bash
python3.10 src/models/train_model.py \
--config configs/model_config.yaml \
--data data/processed/featured_house_data.csv \
--models-dir models \
--mlflow-tracking-uri http://localhost:5555
```

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** The training script expects a flat YAML structure in `configs/model_config.yaml` (as generated by the notebook), not a nested `model:` wrapper. If you encounter a `'NoneType' object is not subscriptable` error, ensure your YAML config file was properly generated by the experimentation notebook first.

## Building FastAPI and Streamlit 

The code for both the apps are available in `model_app/` (FastAPI) and `streamlit_app/` (Streamlit). 

### Building and Launching

1. **Build and launch both services:**
   ```bash
   docker compose -f deployment/model_service/docker-compose.yaml up -d --build
   ```

2. **Verify services are running:**
   ```bash
   docker compose -f deployment/model_service/docker-compose.yaml ps
   ```

Once you have launched both the apps, you should be able to access streamlit web ui and make predictions. 
3. **Push the built images**
```bash
export DOCKERHUB_USERNAME=your-dockerhub-username
docker compose -f deployment/model_service/docker-compose.yaml push
```

4. **Verify images are pushed:**
   ```bash
   # Check local images
   docker images | grep house-price

   # Verify on DockerHub (or check your DockerHub dashboard)
   docker search your-dockerhub-username/house-price-api
   ```

5. **Access the applications:**
   - **FastAPI API Documentation**: [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)
   - **Streamlit Web UI**: [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)


### üîç Testing Connectivity

**Test API endpoint directly:**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/predict" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "sqft": 1500,
  "bedrooms": 3,
  "bathrooms": 2,
  "location": "suburban",
  "year_built": 2000,
  "condition": "Fair"
}'
```

**Test inter-service connectivity:**

1. **Streamlit ‚Üí FastAPI connection:**
   ```bash
   docker compose -f deployment/model_service/docker-compose.yaml exec streamlit \
   python -c "import requests; print('FastAPI Status:', requests.get('http://fastapi:8000/health', timeout=5).status_code)"
   ```

2. **FastAPI service health:**
   ```bash
   docker compose -f deployment/model_service/docker-compose.yaml exec fastapi \
   curl -f http://localhost:8000/health
   ```

3. **Network debugging (if needed):**
   ```bash
   # Access FastAPI container shell
   docker compose -f deployment/model_service/docker-compose.yaml exec fastapi /bin/bash
   
   # Inside container - test network connectivity
   ping streamlit
   nslookup streamlit
   curl http://streamlit:8501
   netstat -tlnp
   ```

### üõ†Ô∏è Development Workflow
```bash
# Stop services
docker compose -f deployment/model_service/docker-compose.yaml down

# Rebuild and restart
docker compose -f deployment/model_service/docker-compose.yaml up -d --build

# View logs
docker compose -f deployment/model_service/docker-compose.yaml logs -f
```

**Clean up:**
```bash
docker compose -f deployment/model_service/docker-compose.yaml down -v
```

Be sure to replace `http://localhost:8000/predict` with actual endpoint based on where its running.
